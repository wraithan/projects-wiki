# Bathroom Fan

## Summary

My bathroom doesn't have a fan, just a window. I was going to add a fan with a
standard switch to the window. Instead I decided it would be cool if the fan
turned on automatically when someone was taking a shower. 

## Part List

### Owned:
* [Spark Core](parts/spark-core.md)
* [DHT 22](parts/dht.md)
* [Case Fan](parts/case-fan.md)

### Need to order:
* 12v power source
* relay (at least 12v 0.5A, switchable by 3.3v)

## Progress

- [x] Get the spark core able to be flashed
- [x] Get DHT 22 lib working
- [x] Figure out case fan pins
- [x] Measure how fast the fan spins
- [ ] Build a software selectable circuit to toggle the fan
- [ ] Push or Poll the data from the spark core
