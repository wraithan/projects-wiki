# Hardware

## Intro

I started dabbling in hardware just before [Internation NodeBots Day 2013](https://github.com/nodebots/nodebotsday/tree/master/2013).
I was going to be helping to organize and wanted to make sure I had a grasp on
how it all worked. So I went online and purchased a while kit of stuff to play
with. I had some various lofty ambitions, as well as some more reasonable ones.
My [Media Keyboard](media-kb.md) was my first project that I had the skills to
develop.

Completing that project gave me perspective and confidence to charge forward on
several more projects. Unfortunately I've not driven any of them to completion
yet. That is the purpose of this wiki. Organizing myself so I can actually
finish some of thse ideas.

## In Progress

* [Bathroom Fan](br-fan.md)
* [Bike Computer](bike.md)

## Finished

* [Media Keyboard](media-kb.md)
