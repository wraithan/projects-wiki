# Software

## Intro

I've been a software developer for the majority of my life. Starting in C++ with
aspirations of writing video games. Moving on to Perl/Java/PHP for my first job.
Then a few years of hacking on my own and discovering python among several
langauges I'd tried. I spent a number of years in that community and taking jobs
doing python. Most recently I've gotten really into JavaScript, specifically
Node.js.
