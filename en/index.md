# Welcome

## Intro

You've managed to stumble upon my project wiki. I have two primary types of
projects. [Hardware](pages/hw/index.md) is where my various electronics projects
live, as well as notes I have about various parts. [Software](pages/sw/index.md)
is where my various programming projects live.

## Who am I?

I'm [Wraithan](http://blog.wraithan.net/) a software developer in Portland, OR.
I mostly program in JavaScript and C++ these days, but I have experience in a
large number of langauges. 

## Contact 

If you have any questions about my projects and you'd like to chat with me in
real time, check to see if the project has its own channel. For projects that
don't have a dedicated channel, you can find me in
[#wraithan](irc://irc.freenode.net:6667/wraithan) on
[freenode.net](http://freenode.net).
